 This project contains three unique models:
 
 <h3> Global Europa </h3>
 A model of how flow influences the Ice-Water interface on a global level
 
 <h3> TwoDModel </h3>
 A model of a 2-D region with a bump that flows away
 
 <h3> DiscModel </h3>
 A model of a 'pancake' like Europa which also has a bump that flows away.
 
 <p> Running the model </p>
 
 All you have to do to see the results is press the '=' run button.
 If you want to adjust the bump on the two local models, then the adjust the parameters 'Gauss2DHeight' or 'Gauss2D' which control that bump.
