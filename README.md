<h3> Abstract </h3> 
Are topographic features on the surface of Europa and other icy worlds isostatically compensated by variations in shell thickness (Airy isostasy)? This is only possible if variations in shell thickness can remain stable over geologic time. In this work we demonstrate that local shell thickness perturbations will relax due to viscous flow in centuries.

We present a model of Europa’s ice crust which includes thermal conduction, viscous flow of ice, and a mobile ice/water interface: the topography along the ice-water interface varies in response to melting, freezing, and ice flow. Temperature-dependent viscosity, conductivity, and density lead to glacier-like flow along the base of the ice shell, as well as solid-state convection in its interior. We considered both small scale processes, such as an isostatically-compensated ridge or lenticula, or heat flux from a hydrothermal plume; and a larger model focusing on melting and flow on the global scale.

Our local model shows that ice-basal topographic features 5 kilometers deep and 4 kilometers wide can be filled in by glacial flow in about 200 years; even very large cavities can be infilled in 1000 years. “Hills” (locally thick areas) are removed faster than “holes”. If a strong local heat flux (10x global average) is applied to the base of the ice, local melting will be prevented by rapid inflow of ice from nearby. On the large scale, global ice flow from the thick cool pole to the warmer and thinner equator removes global-scale topography in about 1 Ma; melting and freezing from this process may lead to a coupled feedback with the ocean flow.

We find that glacial flow at the base of the ice shell is so rapid that Europa’s ice-water interface is likely to be very flat. Local surface topography probably cannot be isostatically compensated by thickness variations: Europa’s mountains may have no roots.


 This project contains three unique models:
 
 <h3> Global Europa </h3>
 A model of how melting, freezing, and flow influences the Ice-Water interface on a global level. 
 
 Starts with a disc with a radius of 2451 km (Radius of Europa * pi/2) and 10 km thick. This block is brought into thermal equilibrium, with the top having temperature varying from 50K to 100K and the bottom being at the melting point of water (273.15 K).
 Next we allow melting and freezing to influence the ice-water interface, creating a thickness profile. The ice is thickest at the 'pole' and thinnest at the equator.
  Finally, we allow flow to also influence the boundary. After running this model for millions of years, we see flow, melting, and freezing working together to influence the final thickness profile. 
 
 <h3> TwoDModel </h3>
 A model of a 2-D region with a bump that flows away
 Starts with a30 km long block, with a bump in the center of it
  After we are at equilibrium, we allow flow and melting to influence the boundary of the system. In a matter of years the bump will vanish. The parameters 'Gauss2DHeight' and 'Gauss2d' parameterize the height and width of the bump respectively.
 
 <h3> DiscModel </h3>
 A model of a 'pancake' like Europa which also has a bump that flows away.
 Starts with a disc, with radius of 30 km, and a small bump on it. 
 After we are at equilibrium, we allow flow and melting to influence the boundary of the system. In a matter of years the bump will vanish. The parameters 'Gauss2DHeight' and 'Gauss2d' parameterize the height and width of the bump respectively.
 
 <h2> Running the model </h2>
 
 All you have to do to see the results is press the '=' run button.
 
 If you want to adjust the bump on the two local models, then the adjust the parameters:
 'Gauss2DHeight' the parameter which controls how  big the bump is
 or
 'Gauss2d' the parameter which controls how wide the bump is
